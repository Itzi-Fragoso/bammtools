ChangeLog for BAMMtools 1.0.1

2014-04-25    Pascal Title   ptitle@umich.edu
        Enhancement: In plotRateThroughTime, if 'xticks' or 'yticks' are set to NULL,
        number and locations of tick marks are automatically determined, as per default
        R plotting behavior. Otherwise, the user can specify a number of tick marks. 

2014-04-12    Pascal Title   ptitle@umich.edu

        Modification: getRateThroughTimeMatrix and plotRateThroughTime now handle
        start.time and end.time as 'time before present' rather than 'time after root'.

2014-03-22    Pascal Title   ptitle@umich.edu

        Bug fix: getRateThroughTimeMatrix now includes root node when node is specified
        and nodetype is 'exclude'.

        Bug fix: subtreeBAMM misnamed some list elements in the bammdata object.

2014-03-13    Pascal Title    ptitle@umich.edu

        Bug fix: getBranchShiftPriors was not reading prior data when passed as a 
        filename.

2014-03-10    Mike Grundler    mcgrundler@gmail.com

        Bug fix: summary.bammdata incorrectly returned a matrix where the number of rate 
        shifts and their posterior frequency were offset by 1. The information printed to
        the console was correct, however, and left unchanged.
